# Used Car Price Analysis
_This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook file "Used Car Pricing Analysis" which contains Python code exexcuted during my lab sessions whilst completeing IBM's 'Data Analysis with Python' course._

**Overview and Aims**

In this project, I explored a range of data analysis techniques in python to predict used car prices, utilising a number of libraries including NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn and Scikit-learn.

This project aims to showcase my skills in data wrangling, data visualisation, statistical analysis and machine learning in Python.
